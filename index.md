# Welcome to the NFT20 Docs

Welcome to the NFT20 documenation. NFT20 is a permissionless p2p protocol to tokenize NFTs and make them tradable on
decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap or Sushiswap.

Anyone with an NFT can create
a new pool or add his NFT to an existing pool and get ERC20 Token derivatives of their
NFTs in a permission-less way, those tokens can be transferred and traded on DEXes
right away.
