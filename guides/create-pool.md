# Create a NFT20 pool for your NFT

Creating a pool for your NFT project is really simple and will help your community achieve liquidity and swaps for all your NFTs in a simple manner.

1. Go to [https://nft.20.io/assets](https://nft.20.io/assets).
1. Click on "ADD ASSET".
1. Paste in the NFT address, we support ERC1155 and ERC721 standards.
1. Pay the TX fees.

Done! You now can go to your asset page within NFT20 and tokenize any NFTs you own.

Here is a video demonstrating the process:
