# Governance

All fees and some decisions of the protocol will be handled by the $muse token holders.

As for now, only the core team can submit proposals but we're always available to discuss new proposal ideas publicly so we can filter the noise together for the voters.

## Why no regular DAO like popular in DEFI Jan 2021?

We don't want to play decentralized teather that is so popular now, and we didn't raise money or printed unlimited tokens with cute pumpamentatls to play governance.
**We are active developers bootstraping real products and until our vision is executed, we won't complete an exit to community.**

We understand this is not for most short term speculators, but because we are working without any funding or pre mine, fun is what keep us going and spending hours reading random speculators posts and voting on those, would kill our flow. **We are creators, not speculators.**
