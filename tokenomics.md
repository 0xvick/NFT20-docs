# Tokenomics

In our lite paper we stated an $NFT20 token distribution, that token will be released in a later period after launch, the distribution will be exactly as stated in the lite paper.

The main reasons of launching the protocol without a token:

**Development costs**, we are working on NFT20 without any funding or token sales, to release $NFT20, audit wraplp.com to offer incentives, and the time it takes to develop and test everything, it would cost us over $20k.

**Product is what matters most, not tokens**. We opted to first focus our limited resources on the product instead of the token.

**Risks**. This is a complex protocol that involves several contracts, we don't want to have a token with extra monetary value before everything is well tested in production.

The token will be released when the protocol is more stable, and the community grows enough to have the funds required, we are always looking for contributors and developers, all our code is open sourced on GH. Any helpful funds for deployment and audits can be sent to our wallet **nft20.eth**.

**In the meantime you can check our governance docs to see how you can get involved right now and get some of the fees the protocol produces.**
